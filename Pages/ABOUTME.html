	My name is Bairon Jusep Vasquez. I was born in the Dominican republic, I am the yougest one of two brothers and two systers. Growing up I was mostly around adults because I use to play Domino almost everyday after finishing up with my school homework.
	I came to the United States in to 2005, alone with my father and one of my brother and syster, I was just 11 years of age. Going to school at first was really dificult since I did not speak english. I learn the language mostly in te street, playing <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/home"> baseball</a> or <a href="https://www.easports.com/fifa"> soccer</a> or <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4/"> video games</a>. At that tme I use to live in the bronx by the 1 train.
